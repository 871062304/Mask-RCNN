# Mask-RCNN
A PyTorch implementation of the architecture of Mask RCNN, serves as an introduction to working with PyTorch

model.py includes the models of ResNet and FPN which were already implemented by the authors of the papers and reproduced in this implementation
nms and RoiAlign are taken from Robb Girshick's implementation of faster RCNN
Focal loss has been added to this implementtaion on lieu of better results as evidenced by the paper on RetinaNets
